Let me tell you a story
Of a faraway land
If you're afraid of the darkness
Baby, reach for my hand

With a crash and a bang
Again and again
I'll give you the best
That a warrior hero can

I am the savior, I am the warrior
I am the hero in your dream
I am the savior, I am the warrior
I wanna show you what I mean
Slay, slay, the dragon's dead
Slay, slay, he won't come back
Slay, slay, we fight the bad tonight, alright

If you come with me now
It may be danger you find
But you don't have to worry
Because it's all in your mind

With a crash and a bang
Again and again
I'll give you the best
That a warrior hero can

I am the savior, I am the warrior
I am the hero in your dream
I am the savior, I am the warrior
I wanna show you what I mean
Slay, slay, the dragon's dead
Slay, slay, he won't come back
Slay, slay, we fight the bad tonight, alright

Slay, slay, we fight the bad
Slay, slay, the dragon's dead
Slay, slay, he won't come back
Slay, slay

With a crash and a bang
Again and again
I'll give you the best
That a warrior hero can

I am the savior, I am the warrior
I am the hero in your dream
I am the savior, I am the warrior
I wanna show you what I mean

I am the savior, I am the warrior
I am the hero in your dream
I am the savior, I am the warrior
I wanna show you what I mean
Slay, slay, the dragon's dead
Slay, slay, he won't come back
Slay, slay, we fight the bad tonight, alright

Alright, alright, alright, alright, alright
We fight the bad tonight, alright
