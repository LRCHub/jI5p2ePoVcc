I was talking to myself
I belong to someone else
Hey, can you tell me who is who?
I'll give you a clue

Follow me
'Cause I know you wanna play
Follow me
Don't you know? I came to slay

We look just like each other
He was something like a brother
You, now you know my face
I'll show you the way

Follow me
Don't you know? I came to slay
Follow me
'Cause I know you wanna play

It's not a dream
Believe me when I say
Don't you know? I came to slay
To slay

Not a dream
You follow me, you make me feel alive
Not a dream
And I'm so glad to have you by my side, oh yeah

Not a dream
And it's turning out exactly as I planned
Not a dream
And I got you eating out the palm of my hand

Not a dream
You can take it back, I'm taking what is mine
Not a dream
And I'll be right here until the end of time

Follow me
Don't you know? I came to slay
Follow me
'Cause I know you wanna play

It's not a dream
Believe me when I say
Don't you know? I came to slay
To slay
